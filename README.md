# Symmetry-In-The-Polar-Plane
Exploring the symmetrical patterns produced by plotting number sequences in polar representations as well as the symmetry of common (and more complex) polar functions.

## Usage:
1. Import main.m and preprocess.m
2. Run preprocess.m - this will produce the most updated version of the struct nseq that contains at least 10,000 data points per number sequence.
3. Run main.m. Two figure windows, "Figure 1: Famous Geometric Number Series" and "Figure 2: Arithmetic Series" should appear along with a user-interactive .mlapp app.
